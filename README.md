## Introduction

### Gmail

#### ClearInbox

Ones like me who want to clear their GMail inbox everyday, there are three steps to do with this:

1. Classify the e-mail by where it is from.
2. Mark it with a label.
3. Move it to archive.

This Google APP Script is tend to do those stuff automatically.
